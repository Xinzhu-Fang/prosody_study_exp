+ See `tAll_Exps.csv` for experiments parameters
+ See `[exp name]/tAll_trials.csv` for trials parameters for each exp. Each exp dir has its own `image/`.

There are three English versions of this as of Nov, 2019: `exp0`, `exp1`, and `exp2`. The questions are the same across exps for all trials, the pictures and answers are the same across exps for all ITEM trials, but different for fillers trials depending on if we need more no or yes.
