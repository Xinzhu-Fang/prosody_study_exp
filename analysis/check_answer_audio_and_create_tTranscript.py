#run this file at three stages:
#    1: get the auto fail. Then enter the trial num to reject
#    2: remove the rejected trial to output the final tTranscript
# in number, select the row index by holding cmd, copy to atom. Once done, repleace \r?\n\s*\n with \n
# and then https://discuss.atom.io/t/add-a-at-the-end-of-each-line/59492/4. Save the file as [exp_id]_reject_index.py, and save notes to there too. 
#    3: find out if there is a speaker who has only a few trials, exclude them, there are two reasons behind this:
# one is that they were rejected a lot, probably not a native speaker
# the other is that there were not many files which could be caused by that 1) this person sent empty data, 2)most of this person's data
# was not succefully transmitted, 3) this person returned the hit.
